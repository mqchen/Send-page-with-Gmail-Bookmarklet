## Send page with Gmail Bookmarklet

This is a small bookmarklet which opens a new Gmail window in compose-mode with subject
and body already filled out. The page's title is set as the subject and the page's url
is set as the body.

## Install

* Download and open the bookmarklet.html file in a browser
* Drag the "Send page with Gmail" link to your bookmarks bar

## Usage

Once the bookmarklet is in your bookmarks bar, simply click it when you are on a page
you wish to send to someone and a pop-up should appear.

## Known issues

* Unfortunately it removes your email signature.
* The URL inserted in the boy is in plain-text (but most email clients makes a link)
